His treachery runs deeper than you know. By <font color="blue">foul(49)</font> <font style="font-weight:bold" color="red">craft(54)</font>, Saruman has crossed Orcs with Goblin Men ... He’s <font style="font-weight:bold" color="red">breeding(8)</font> an army in the <font color="blue">caverns(10)</font> of Isengard.

ANGLE ON: STRIDER watches from the shadows ... as BOROMIR <font style="font-weight:bold" color="red">strolls(1)</font> through the darkened gallery. BOROMIR’S eyes are drawn to an old FRESCO on the wall ... <font style="font-weight:bold" color="red">depicting(4)</font> ISILDUR defeating<br>
SAURON.<br>
<br>
BOROMIR turns suddenly and notices STRIDER, looking at him. He looks STRIDER up and down, confused for a moment.<br>
93.<br>
BOROMIR<br>
<br>
You are no Elf.<br>
<br>
STRIDER<br>
Men of the South are welcome here.<br>
<br>
BOROMIR<br>
Who are you?<br>
<br>
STRIDER<br>
I am a friend to Gandalf the Grey.<br>
<br>
BOROMIR <i>nods(62)</i>, understanding Strider’s <font style="font-weight:bold" color="red">vagueness(33)</font>.<br>
<br>
BOROMIR<br>
<br>
Then we are here on common purpose ...<br>
friend.<br>
<br>
BOROMIR smiles uncomfortably. STRIDER only looks at him silently.<br>
<br>
BOROMIR looks with <font style="font-weight:bold" color="red">WONDERMENT(2)</font> at NARSIL, the BROKEN BLADE of ELENDIL, which lies on a cloth-covered <i>plinth(2)</i>.<br>
<br>
BOROMIR (quiet <font color="blue">awe(2)</font>)<br>
<br>
The <i>shards(37)</i> of Narsil ... the blade that cut the Ring from Sauron's hand.<br>
<br>
BOROMIR picks up the sword and gently touches the blade.<br>
<br>
CLOSE ON: a small <font style="font-weight:bold" color="red">bloom(65)</font> of blood appears on BOROMIR’S<br>
finger...<br>
<br>
BOROMIR<br>
Still sharp.<br>
<br>
He slowly looks over to STRIDER, as if sensing a connection.<br>
<br>
BOROMIR<br>
<br>
But no more than a broken <i>heirloom(45)</i>.<br>
<br>
BOROMIR replaces the blade, but it <i>clatters(4637)</i> to the floor. BOROMIR walks away, leaving STRIDER sitting alone.<br>
<br>
CLOSE ON: STRIDER picks up the broken <i>hilt(5)</i>, as ARWEN appears behind him.<br>
<br>
94.<br>
<br>
(2)<br>
<br>
ARWEN<br>
<br>
Why do you fear the past? You are<br>
Isildur's <font style="font-weight:bold" color="red">heir(32)</font>, not Isildur himself.<br>
<br>
You are not bound to his fate.<br>
<br>
STRIDER<br>
<br>
The same blood <font style="font-weight:bold" color="red">flows(9)</font> in my veins ...<br>
the same weakness...<br>
<br>
ARWEN<br>
<br>
Your time will come. You will face the same evil. And you will defeat<br>
<br>
it.<br>
<br>
(Elvish: with subtitles) A si i-Dhúath ú-orthor, Aragorn. Ú or le a ú or nin.<br>
<br>
The shadow does not hold <font style="font-weight:bold" color="red">sway(78)</font> yet ...<br>
Not over you and not over me.<br>
<br>
CUT TO:<br>
<br>
EXT. RIVENDELL VALLEY - NIGHT<br>
<br>
Night falls upon the beautiful valley of RIVENDELL ... still and quiet.<br>
<br>
EXT. RIVENDELL WATERFALL - NIGHT<br>
<br>
STRIDER and ARWEN stand together upon a stone bridge ... the EVENSTAR at ARWEN’S <font style="font-weight:bold" color="red">breast(1)</font> <font style="font-weight:bold" color="red">shines(5)</font> in the <i>moonlight(9)</i>.<br>
<br>
ARWEN<br>
<br>
(Elvish: with subtitles) Renech i lu i erui govannen?<br>
<br>
Do you remember when we first met?<br>
<br>
STRIDER<br>
<br>
(Elvish: with subtitles) Nauthannem i ned ol reniannen.<br>
<br>
I thought I had <font style="font-weight:bold" color="red">strayed(5108)</font> into a dream.<br>
<br>
ARWEN reaches up and gently touches the GREY at STRIDER’S temples.<br>
95.<br>
ARWEN<br>
<br>
(Elvish: with subtitles) Gwenwin in enninath. U-arnech in naeth i si celich.<br>
<br>
Long years have passed. You did not have the cares you carry now.<br>
<br>
ARWEN looks into STRIDER’S eyes.<br>
<br>
ARWEN<br>
<br>
(Elvish: with subtitles) Renech i beth i pennen?<br>
<br>
Do you remember what I told you?<br>
<br>
ARWEN reaches for STRIDER’S hand...<br>
<br>
STRIDER (quietly)<br>
<br>
You said you would bind yourself to me, and <font style="font-weight:bold" color="red">forsaking(16)</font> immortal life<br>
<br>
of your people.<br>
<br>
ARWEN (whisper)<br>
<br>
And to that I hold. I would rather share one lifetime with you than face all the Ages of this world alone.<br>
<br>
CLOSE ON: STRIDER looks down. In his hand lies the EVENSTAR.<br>
<br>
ARWEN<br>
<br>
I choose a mortal life.<br>
<br>
STRIDER<br>
<br>
You cannot give me this.<br>
<br>
ARWEN<br>
<br>
It is mine to give to whom I will, like my heart.<br>
<br>
ARWEN closes STRIDER’S fingers around the <font style="font-weight:bold" color="red">jewel(6)</font>.<br>
<br>
ARWEN leans towards STRIDER, gently kissing him.<br>

INT. COUNCIL CHAMBER, RIVENDELL - DAY<br>
<br>
IMAGES from the PROLOGUE: the RINGS being given to the ELVES, DWARVES, and MEN.<br>
<br>
ELROND (V.O.)<br>
<br>
Three Rings for the Elven-kings under the sky,<br>
<br>
Seven for the Dwarf-lords in their halls of stone,<br>
<br>
Nine for Mortal Men <i>doomed(18)</i> to die, One for the Dark Lord on his dark throne<br>
<br>
In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.<br>
<br>
One Ring to rule them all. One Ring to find them,<br>
<br>
One Ring to bring them all together and in the darkness bind them,<br>
<br>
In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.<br>
<br>
CLOSE ON: FRODO opens his hand ... the RING lies in his palm. He looks up.<br>
<br>
ANGLE ON: ELROND addresses the COUNCIL...<br>
<br>
ELROND<br>
Strangers from distant lands ...<br>
<br>
friends of old. You have been summoned here to answer the threat of Mordor. Middle-Earth stands upon the <font style="font-weight:bold" color="red">brink(8)</font> of destruction. None can escape it. You will unite ... or you will fall. Each race is bound to this fate ... this one <font color="blue">doom(435)</font>...<br>
<br>
FRODO sits <i>amongst(2)</i> a council of FREE-PEOPLES of Middle earth, ELROND stands before them, addressing GANDALF, STRIDER, LEGOLAS, and 20 other ELVES, DWARVES, and MEN.<br>
<br>
ELROND<br>
Bring forth the Ring, Frodo.<br>
<br>
ANGLE ON: FRODO steps forward and moves towards a stone <i>PLINTH(2)</i>. He places the RING on the <i>plinth(2)</i> and returns to his seat.<br>
<br>
BOROMIR (shocked)<br>
So it is true!<br>
97.<br>
LEGOLAS (disbelief)<br>
Sauron’s Ring! The Ring of Power!<br>
<br>
GIMLI<br>
<br>
(grim) The <font color="blue">doom(435)</font> of man!<br>
<br>
ON THE SOUNDTRACK: The <font color="blue">HUM(47)</font> of the RING sounds.<br>
<br>
ANGLE ON: Several members of the COUNCIL take notice. BOROMIR stands and begins to approach the RING, as if drawn to it.<br>
<br>
BOROMIR<br>
<br>
In a dream, I saw the eastern sky grow dark, but in the West a pale light <i>lingered(2)</i>. A voice was crying: “Your <font color="blue">doom(435)</font> is near at hand. Isildur’s <font style="font-weight:bold" color="red">Bane(2)</font> is found.”<br>
<br>
ANGLE ON: ELROND and GANDALF exchange glances. BOROMIR reaches for the RING.<br>
<br>
BOROMIR<br>
Isildur’s <font style="font-weight:bold" color="red">Bane(2)</font>.<br>
<br>
ELROND (standing)<br>
<br>
Boromir!<br>
<br>
ANGLE ON: GANDALF stands and speaks in the BLACK TONGUE.<br>
<br>
ON THE SOUNDTRACK: The RING responds to GANDALF.<br>
<br>
ANGLES ON: BOROMIR <i>staggers(23)</i> back to his chair ... the sky<br>
darkens ... thunder rolls ... the ground trembles...<br>
<br>
GANDALF (Black Speech)<br>
<br>
Ash nazg durbatulûk, ash nazg gimbatul, ash nazg thrakatulûk<br>
agh burzum-ishi krimpatul.<br>
<br>
One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them,<br>
<br>
One Ring to bring them all and in the Darkness bind them.<br>
98.<br>
<br>
(2)<br>
<br>
Nature returns to normal. ELROND looks to GANDALF.<br>
<br>
ELROND (<i>sternly(23)</i>)<br>
<br>
Never before has any voice uttered the words of that tongue here in Imladris.<br>
<br>
GANDALF<br>
<br>
I do not ask your pardon, Master Elrond, for the Black Speech of Mordor may yet be heard in every corner of the West! The Ring is altogether evil.<br>
<br>
ANGLE ON: GANDALF returns to his seat.<br>
<br>
ANGLE ON: BOROMIR shakes his head. He stands again to make his case to the COUNCIL.<br>
<br>
BOROMIR<br>
<br>
It is a gift ... a gift to the foes of Mordor! Why not use this Ring? Long has my father, the Steward of Gondor, kept the forces of Mordor at bay ... by the blood of our people are your lands kept safe. Give Gondor the weapon of the enemy ... let us use it against him!<br>
<br>
STRIDER<br>
<br>
You cannot wield it. None of us can. The One Ring answers to Sauron alone<br>
<br>
... it has no other master.<br>
<br>
ANGLE ON: BOROMIR turns and looks at STRIDER, <font style="font-weight:bold" color="red">coolly(3)</font>.<br>
<br>
BOROMIR<br>
<br>
And what would a <i>Ranger(1)</i> know of this matter?<br>
<br>
STRIDER says nothing and BOROMIR turns away <font style="font-weight:bold" color="red">dismissively(21)</font>.<br>
<br>
ANGLE ON: LEGOLAS stands...<br>
<br>
LEGOLAS<br>
<br>
This is no <font style="font-weight:bold" color="red">mere(314)</font> <i>Ranger(1)</i>. He is Aragorn, son of Arathorn. You <i>owe(401)</i> him your <i>allegiance(1)</i>.<br>
<br>
99.<br>
<br>
(3)<br>
<br>
ANGLE ON: FRODO looks at STRIDER <font style="font-weight:bold" color="red">questioningly(1)</font> ... BOROMIR turns sharply.<br>
<br>
BOROMIR (quiet disbelief)<br>
<br>
Aragorn? This is Isildur's <font style="font-weight:bold" color="red">heir(32)</font>?<br>
<br>
LEGOLAS<br>
<br>
And <font style="font-weight:bold" color="red">heir(32)</font> to the throne of Gondor.<br>
<br>
STRIDER<br>
<br>
(Elvish: with subtitles) Havo dad, Legolas...<br>
<br>
Sit down, Legolas...<br>
<br>
BOROMIR<br>
<br>
Gondor has no king.<br>
<br>
GANDALF<br>
<br>
Aragorn is right ... we cannot use it.<br>
<br>
ELROND<br>
<br>
You have only one choice ... the Ring must be destroyed.<br>
<br>
ON THE SOUNDTRACK: The <font color="blue">HUM(47)</font> OF THE RING seems to grow louder in FRODO’S ears.<br>
<br>
ANGLE ON: GIMLI suddenly stands, excited.<br>
<br>
GIMLI<br>
Then ... what are we waiting for?<br>
<br>
GIMLI suddenly rushes forward! He swings his axe down on the RING. The axe <i>SHATTERS(43)</i> with a deafening CRACK! GIMLI falls backwards staring in disbelief at the RING ... unharmed!<br>
<br>
ANGLE ON: FRODO <i>winces(86)</i> as an angry IMAGE of the <font color="blue">FIERY(1)</font> EYE hits him! He <i>slumps(1396)</i> in his chair, clutching his forehead. GANDALF looks at him with concern.<br>
<br>
ELROND<br>
<br>
The Ring cannot be destroyed, Gimli, son of Glóin, by any <font style="font-weight:bold" color="red">craft(54)</font> that we here possess. The Ring was made in the fires of Mount <font color="blue">Doom(435)</font> ... only there can it be <font style="font-weight:bold" color="red">unmade(77)</font>.<br>
<br>
(MORE)<br>
(CONTINUED)<br>
 <br>
100.<br>
<br>
(4)<br>
<br>
ELROND<br>
<br>
It must be taken deep into Mordor, and cast back into the <font color="blue">fiery(1)</font> <font style="font-weight:bold" color="red">chasm(355)</font> from <font style="font-weight:bold" color="red">whence(26)</font> it came. One of you must do this.<br>
<br>
<i>STUNNED(2)</i> SILENCE ... the council sits with <font style="font-weight:bold" color="red">downcast(61)</font> eyes, as if a great <font color="blue">dread(41)</font> has <font color="blue">descended(1)</font> upon them.<br>
<br>
BOROMIR addresses the council in a quiet voice.<br>
<br>
BOROMIR<br>
<br>
One does not simply walk into Mordor. Its Black Gates are guarded by more than just Orcs. There is evil there that does not sleep and the Great Eye is ever <i>watchful(44)</i>. It is a <i>barren(338)</i> <i>wasteland(35)</i> riddled with fire, and ash and dust ... the very air you breathe is a poisonous <font style="font-weight:bold" color="red">fume(2)</font>. Not with ten thousand Men could you do this. It is <i>folly(1)</i>.<br>
<br>
LEGOLAS<br>
<br>
Have you heard nothing Lord Elrond has said? The Ring must be destroyed.<br>
<br>
GIMLI<br>
<br>
And I suppose you think you're the one to do it?<br>
<br>
BOROMIR<br>
<br>
And what if we fail, what then? What happens when Sauron takes back what is his?<br>
<br>
GIMLI leaps to his feet!<br>
<br>
GIMLI<br>
<br>
I will be dead before I see the Ring in the hands of an Elf!<br>
<br>
A STORM OF ARGUMENT <i>erupts(208)</i> around the room.<br>
<br>
CLOSE ON: FRODO ... sound disappears as he watches in SLOW MOTION ... the angry faces, the shaking fists, the <font style="font-weight:bold" color="red">accusatory(19)</font> fingers, his eyes move to the RING ... THE <font color="blue">HUM(47)</font> grows louder in his head.<br>
101.<br>
<br>
(5)<br>
<br>
GIMLI (shouting)<br>
Never trust an Elf!<br>
<br>
CLOSE ON: THE RING fills the screen ... streams of blood flow across the surface ... flames <i>flicker(12)</i> within the GOLD BAND.<br>
<br>
GANDALF<br>
<br>
Do you not understand? While we <font style="font-weight:bold" color="red">bicker(43)</font> <i>amongst(2)</i> ourselves, Sauron’s power grows! No one will escape it. You will all be destroyed, with your homes burnt and your families put to the sword!<br>
<br>
CLOSE ON: FRODO ... breathing rapidly, CAUGHT in the grip of his <i>hideous(22)</i> vision. With a huge effort of will, FRODO tears his <font color="blue">gaze(2)</font> upon the RING.<br>
<br>
ANGLE ON: FRODO suddenly stands ... he speaks in a strong, clear voice.<br>
<br>
FRODO<br>
<br>
I will take it ... I will take it ...<br>
<br>
I will take the Ring to Mordor.<br>
<br>
SUDDEN SILENCE ... FRODO looks around the room at the <font color="blue">astonished(32)</font> faces.<br>
<br>
FRODO (quietly)<br>
<br>
Though I do not know the way.<br>
<br>
ANGLE ON: GANDALF rises to his feet.<br>
<br>
GANDALF<br>
I will help you bear this <font style="font-weight:bold" color="red">burden(4)</font>, Frodo<br>
<br>
Baggins, as long as it is yours to bear.<br>
<br>
ARAGORN<br>
<br>
If by my life or death I can protect you, I will.<br>
(<i>kneels(7)</i> before Frodo)<br>
<br>
...you have my sword.<br>
<br>
ARAGORN steps forward ... followed by LEGOLAS and GIMLI.<br>
<br>
LEGOLAS<br>
<br>
And you have my bow.<br>
102.<br>
<br>
(6)<br>
<br>
GIMLI<br>
<br>
And my axe.<br>
<br>
ANGLE ON: BOROMIR looks at them all and then walks to FRODO.<br>
<br>
BOROMIR<br>
<br>
You carry the <font style="font-weight:bold" color="red">fates(43)</font> of us all, little one.<br>
<br>
BOROMIR looks towards ELROND and GANDALF.<br>
<br>
BOROMIR<br>
<br>
If this is indeed the will of the<br>
Council, then Gondor will see it done.<br>
<br>
ANGLE ON: FRODO stares in wonder as the GREATEST FIGHTERS in all Middle earth stand at his side.<br>
<br>
SAM (unseen)<br>
<br>
Here!<br>
<br>
A SUDDEN NOISE ... SAM pops up from behind a BUSH!<br>
<br>
SAM<br>
<br>
Mr. Frodo's not going anywhere without me.<br>
<br>
ELROND<br>
<br>
No, indeed ... it is hardly possible to separate you ... even when he is summoned to a secret Council and you are not.<br>
<br>
ANGLE ON: MERRY and PIPPIN jump up from behind another bush!<br>
<br>
MERRY<br>
<br>
Oi! We're coming too! You'd have to send us home tied up in a <i>sack(712)</i> to stop us.<br>
<br>
PIPPIN<br>
Anyway ... you need people of intelligence<br>
<br>
on this sort of mission ... quest ...<br>
thing...<br>
<br>
MERRY<br>
Well, that rules you out, <i>Pip(940)</i>.<br>
103.<br>
<br>

<br>
ELROND <i>SURVEYS(60)</i> THE GROUP.<br>
<br>
ELROND (thoughtfully)<br>
<br>
Nine companions ... so be it. (announcing)<br>
<br>
You shall be the FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING.<br>
<br>
PIPPIN<br>
Great. Where are we going?<br>
<br>
CUT TO:<br>

EXT. GILRAEN’S MEMORIAL, RIVENDELL - DAWN<br>
<br>
CLOSE ON: A HAND gently and <font style="font-weight:bold" color="red">reverently(28)</font> removes <font color="blue">debris(6186)</font> from the base and form of a STATUE<br>
<br>
ANGLE ON: The STATUE OF GILRAEN’S hands are <font color="blue">folded(3)</font> before her, and her head is hooded.<br>
<br>
ANGLE ON: ARAGORN stands back and gazes into her sad face.<br>
<br>
ELROND (O.S.) (Elvish; with subtitles)<br>
<br>
Anirne hene beriad i chên în. Ned Imladris nauthant e le beriathar aen.<br>
<br>
She wanted to protect her child. She thought that in Rivendell you would be safe.<br>
<br>
ANGLE ON: ELROND approaches ARAGORN.<br>
<br>
ANGLE ON: ARAGORN pays little attention to ELROND. He caresses the face of his MOTHER’S STATUE.<br>
<br>
ANGLE ON: ELROND approaches from behind ARAGORN.<br>
<br>
ELROND<br>
<br>
In her heart, your mother knew you’d be hunted all your life. That you’d never escape your fate. The skill of the Elves can reforge the sword of kings, but only you have the power to wield it.<br>
104.<br>
CLOSE ON: ARAGORN TURNS to him.<br>
<br>
ARAGORN<br>
<br>
I do not want that power. I have never wanted it.<br>
<br>
ELROND<br>
You are the last of that <i>bloodline(952)</i>.<br>

There is no other.<br>

BRIGHT.<br>
BILBO<br>
<br>
My old sword “Sting” ... here, take it!<br>
<br>
BILBO offers STING to FRODO.<br>
<br>
FRODO<br>
It's so light!<br>
<br>
BILBO<br>
<br>
Yes, yes, made by the Elves, you know. The blade glows blue when Orcs are<br>
<br>
close ... and it’s times like that, my lad, when you have to be extra careful.<br>
<br>
BILBO <font style="font-weight:bold" color="red">unwraps(246)</font> a SMALL SHIRT OF CLOSE <i>WOVEN(66)</i> MAIL.<br>
<br>
BILBO<br>
<br>
Here’s a pretty thing. Mithril, as light as a feather, and as hard as dragon scales. Let me see you put it on. Come on.<br>
<br>
CLOSE ON: FRODO <font style="font-weight:bold" color="red">peels(62)</font> off his SHIRT ... revealing the RING on the CHAIN around his neck.<br>
<br>
BILBO (<font style="font-weight:bold" color="red">entranced(1501)</font>)<br>
Oh! My old Ring...<br>
<br>
105.<br>
FRODO <i>frowns(8)</i> as BILBO moves toward him.<br>
<br>
BILBO<br>
<br>
I should very much like to hold it again, one last time.<br>
<br>
BILBO reaches forward, eyes locked on the RING.<br>
<br>
ANGLE ON: SUDDENLY! A SHADOW <i>passes(12)</i> across BILBO ... for a split second he becomes a <font color="blue">WRINKLED(8)</font> CREATURE with a HUNGRY FACE and<br>
<font color="blue">BONY(2)</font>, GROPING HANDS.<br>
<br>
ANGLE ON: FRODO pulls away, shocked...<br>
<br>
ANGLE ON: THE SHADOW <i>passes(12)</i>... BILBO <i>slumps(1396)</i> into a chair, his head in his hands. BILBO <font style="font-weight:bold" color="red">falters(2)</font> ... his eyes filling with tears.<br>
<br>
BILBO<br>
<br>
Oh!<br>
<br>
(sad)<br>
<br>
I'm sorry, that I brought this upon you, my boy. I'm sorry that you must<br>
<br>
carry this <font style="font-weight:bold" color="red">burden(4)</font>. I'm sorry for everything.<br>

EXT. RIVENDELL TERRACE - DAY<br>
<br>
ANGLE ON: ELROND and FRODO walk towards the rest of the FELLOWSHIP waiting at the Gate of RIVENDELL.<br>
<br>
ELROND<br>
<br>
The time has come for the Ring to set out. You cannot count on your journey being aided by war or force. You will pass into the <font style="font-weight:bold" color="red">domain(3)</font> of the Enemy far<br>
from aid. Do you still hold to your<br>
<br>
word Frodo, that you will be the Ring-<i>bearer(28)</i>?<br>
<br>
FRODO<br>
<br>
I do. I must. I will go with Sam.<br>
<br>
106.<br>
ELROND<br>
<br>
Then I cannot help you much, not even<br>
with counsel. I can <font style="font-weight:bold" color="red">foresee(18)</font> very little<br>
<br>
of your road; and how your task is to	be achieve<br>
Mountains, and draws <font style="font-weight:bold" color="red">nigh(1)</font> even to the<br>
<br>
borders of  the <font style="font-weight:bold" color="red">Greyflood(238)</font>; and under the<br>
<br>
Shadow all is dark to me. You will meet<br>
many foes, some open, and some<br>
<br>
<i>disguised(49)</i>; and you may find friends<br>
<br>
upon your way when you least look for<br>
it. I will send out messages, such as I<br>
<br>
can <font style="font-weight:bold" color="red">contrive(163)</font>, to those whom I know in<br>
<br>
the wide world; but so <font style="font-weight:bold" color="red">perilous(45)</font> have<br>

Soon, Master Elf, you will enjoy the <font style="font-weight:bold" color="red">fabled(63)</font> hospitality of the Dwarves; roaring fires, <font style="font-weight:bold" color="red">malt(22)</font> beer, red meat off the bone! This, my friend, is the home of my cousin Balin ... And they call this a mine.<br>
<br>
(<i>snorting(6)</i>) A mine!<br>
<br>
ANGLE ON: A GLOW from GANDALF’S <i>STAFF(157)</i> suddenly lights the chamber ... The FELLOWSHIP <font style="font-weight:bold" color="red">recoil(10)</font> in HORROR! Many DWARF SKELETONS are <i>strewn(5)</i> about, clearly in the dead of some old battle ... the <font style="font-weight:bold" color="red">rusting(3)</font> armor and shields are <i>peppered(7)</i> with arrows and axes<br>
<br>
BOROMIR (<font color="blue">grimly(2)</font>)<br>
<br>
This is no mine ... It's a tomb!<br>
<br>
GIMLI (in horror)<br>
Oh ... no ... no ... no...!<br>
<br>
LEGOLAS pulls a <i>crude(91)</i> arrow out of a SKELETON.<br>
<br>
LEGOLAS<br>
<br>
Goblins.<br>
<br>
The FELLOWSHIP draw swords and back away, towards the ENTRANCE.<br>
<br>
BOROMIR<br>
<br>
We make for the Gap of Rohan. We should never have come here.<br>
<br>
EXT. MORIA GATE - NIGHT<br>
<br>
ANGLE ON: FRODO is suddenly PULLED TO THE GROUND! A LONG <font style="font-weight:bold" color="red">SINUOUS(68)</font> <font style="font-weight:bold" color="red">TENTACLE(27)</font> is wrapped around FRODO’S <i>ankle(94)</i> and is dragging him towards the lake!<br>
120.<br>
FRODO CRIES OUT as ARAGORN and BOROMIR rush forward! ARAGORN <i>severs(75)</i> the <font style="font-weight:bold" color="red">TENTACLE(27)</font> holding FRODO, and pulls him to safety ...<br>
<br>
BOROMIR <font style="font-weight:bold" color="red">hacks(56)</font> at the other <font style="font-weight:bold" color="red">WRITHING(91)</font> <font color="blue">LIMBS(152)</font>, 20 more <font style="font-weight:bold" color="red">tentacles(25)</font> <i>ripple(46)</i> out of the LAKE! The dark water <font style="font-weight:bold" color="red">BOILS(29)</font> as the <i>hideous(22)</i> beast <i>lashes(46)</i> out at the FELLOWSHIP!<br>
<br>
Again the creature <i>grabs(4)</i> FRODO and pulls him to the lake. FRODO is <i>flung(3)</i> in the air as the FELLOWSHIP battle the creature. ARAGORN <font style="font-weight:bold" color="red">hacks(56)</font> at a <font style="font-weight:bold" color="red">tentacle(27)</font> ... FRODO is released, falling into BOROMIR’S arms.<br>
