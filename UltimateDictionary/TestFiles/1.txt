LEGOLAS shoots an ARROW into the creature’s head, gaining a few vital seconds for ARAGORN and BOROMIR as they race out of the water with FRODO. The FELLOWSHIP hurriedly back away from the CREATURE ... retreating into the MORIA CHAMBER as many COILING ARMS seize the large doors.

INT. MORIA GATE - NIGHT

With a shattering echo, the creature rips the doors away, creating a rock slide that crashes down the CLIFF FACE. Within seconds, tons of rock seal the doorway ... throwing the FELLOWSHIP into PITCH BLACKNESS.

ANGLE ON: A faint light rises from GANDALF’S staff, throwing a CREEPY GLOW across the old wizard’s face.

GANDALF (ominous)

Now we have but one choice ... we must face the long dark of Moria. Be on your guard ... there are older and fouler things than the Orcs in the deep places of the world.

CUT TO:

INT. NEW CHAMBER, MORIA - NIGHT

WIDE ON: THE FELLOWSHIP crossing a precarious bridge above deep mine workings.

(CONTINUED)
 
121.

CONTINUED:

GANDALF

Quietly, now. It’s a four day journey to the other side. Let us hope that our presence will go unnoticed.

INT. MORIA MITHRIL MINE - NIGHT

ANGLE ON: The FELLOWSHIP enter a CHAMBER with old ropes and ancient ladders.

ANGLE ON: GANDALF touches a shining substance on the wall.

GANDALF

The wealth of Moria was not in gold or jewels but mithril.

GANDALF holds his staff over the expansive drop beside them. The FELLOWSHIP looks down.


ANGLE ON: The ENDLESS DEPTH of the mine. A FAINT, BLUE GLOW issues from its depths. It looks all but abandoned.

The FELLOWSHIP continues onward.

GANDALF

Bilbo had a shirt of mithril rings that Thorin gave him.

GIMLI

Oh, that was a kingly gift.

GANDALF

Yes. I never told him, but its worth was greater than the value of the Shire.

CLOSE ON: FRODO’S eyes widen.

CUT TO:

INT. MORIA CEMETERY CAVERN - NIGHT

They continue up a steep stair, passing through a DWARF CEMETERY. The graves are despoiled ... DWARF SKELETONS are strewn about and GOBLIN GRAFFITI is scrawled on monuments in DRIED DWARF BLOOD. THE ATMOSPHERE is very sinister.

CUT TO:
 
122.

INT. MORIA TUNNEL FORK - NIGHT

The path splits into three passages ... each disappearing into dark tunnel. GANDALF pauses, frowning.

GANDALF
I have no memory of this place.

LATER...

THE FELLOWSHIP are nervously waiting ... while GANDALF sits, staring intently at the 3 tunnel mouths in front of him. He appears to be in some kind of trance.

CLOSE ON: FRODO turns at the sound of a faint noise down the tunnel behind them.

PIPPIN
Are we lost?

MERRY

No. I don’t think we are. Shhh,

Gandalf’s thinking.

PIPPIN

Merry!

MERRY

What?

PIPPIN
I'm hungry.

FRODO’S POV: a sudden glimpse of a creature darting in the darkness. FRODO is nervous...he approaches GANDALF.

FRODO (whispers)

There's something down there.

GANDALF (quietly)
It's Gollum.

FRODO
Gollum!

GANDALF

He's been following us for three days.

(CONTINUED)
 
123.

CONTINUED:

TEASING SHOT: An emaciated, leering creature.

FRODO (disbelieving)
He escaped from the dungeons of Barad-dûr?

GANDALF

Escaped ... or was set loose. And now the Ring has drawn him here ... he will never be rid of his need for it. He hates and loves the Ring, as he hates and loves himself. Sméagol’s life is a sad story.

GANDALF catches FRODO’S look of surprise.

GANDALF (CONT’D)

Yes ... Sméagol he was once called ...

Before the Ring came to him, before it drove him mad.

GOLLUM’S withered fingers are gripping the cave wall ... his LARGE LUMINOUS eyes blinking with malice.

FRODO

(grim)

It’s a pity Bilbo didn't kill him when he had the chance.

GANDALF

Pity? It was pity that stayed Bilbo’s hand. Many that live deserve death, and some that die deserve life. Can you give it to them, Frodo?

FRODO frowns.

GANDALF (CONT’D)

Do not be too eager to deal out death in judgment ... even the very wise cannot see all ends. My heart tells me that Gollum has some part to play yet, for good or ill before this is over. The pity of Bilbo may rule the fate of many.

FRODO

I wish the Ring had never come to me

... I wish none of this had happened.
(CONTINUED)
 
124.

CONTINUED: (2)

GANDALF

So do all who live to see such times, but that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us.

There is a note of finality in GANDALF’S voice.

GANDALF (CONT’D)

There are other forces at work in this world, Frodo, besides the will of evil. Bilbo was meant to find the Ring. In which case, you also were meant to have it ... and that is an encouraging thought.

(sudden brightness) Ah! It's that way.

GANDALF points at the right hand tunnel ... the FELLOWSHIP scramble to their feet.

MERRY (relieved)

He's remembered!

GANDALF

No. But the air doesn’t smell so foul down here. If in doubt, Meriadoc, always follow your nose!
(laughs)

Yes...

INT. DWARROWDELF CHAMBER, MORIA - DAY

The FELLOWSHIP pass under an arched doorway into a black and
empty space. GANDALF pauses...

GANDALF
Let me risk a little more light.

GANDALF taps his staff ... for a brief moment a light blazes ...
like a silent FLASH OF LIGHTNING. GREAT SHADOWS spring up and

flee...

GANDALF

Behold! The great realm and Dwarf-city of Dwarrowdelf.

(CONTINUED)
 
125.

CONTINUED:

ANGLE ON: FRODO gasps at the brief sight of a roof, far above their heads, upheld by many mighty pillars of stone.

Before them stretches a huge empty hall, with black walls, polished and smooth as glass.

SAM

Well, there's an eye opener and no mistake!

Ahead of them, a wooden door has been smashed. BLACK ARROWS are embedded in the timbers. TWO GOBLIN SKELETONS lie in the doorway. GIMLI rushes ahead...

GANDALF

Gimli!!

CUT TO:

INT. BALIN’S TOMB, MORIA - DAY

GIMLI rushes into another vast empty chamber ... lit with a narrow shaft of sunlight, beaming in from a small hole near the roof. DWARF AND GOBLIN SKELETONS are piled high. In the far corner sits a stone walled WELL. A SHAFT OF LIGHT falls directly onto a stone table in the middle of the room: a single oblong block, about 4 feet high, topped with a great slab of white stone. GIMLI falls to his knees...

GIMLI

No...no...oh, no!

GIMLI sobs.

GANDALF quietly reads an inscription of runes, carved onto the white stone slab.

GANDALF

“Here lies Balin, son of Fundin, Lord of Moria.” He is dead, then. It’s as I feared.

GIMLI

(chanting softly, sobbing) Kilmin malur ni zaram kalil ra narag. Kheled-zâram ... Balin tazlifi.


(CONTINUED)
 
126.

CONTINUED:

GANDALF carefully lifts the rotting remains of a book from the white stone slab. It has been slashed and stabbed ... and appears to be covered in DRIED BLOOD. The pages crack and break as he opens it.

LEGOLAS

(urgent whisper to Aragorn) We must move on. We cannot linger.

GANDALF (reading)

“They have taken the Bridge and the second hall: we have barred the gates ... but cannot hold them for long ... the ground shakes ... drums drums in the deep ... we cannot get out. A shadow moves in the dark. Will no-one save us? They are coming.”

ANGLE ON: Unnerved, PIPPIN backs away nervously ... He stumbles against the well, sending a precariously balanced ARMORED SKELETON tumbling in!

MERRY reaches out, GRABBING hold of PIPPIN before he falls. THE FELLOWSHIP freeze in stunned silence as the armored skeleton clatters down the deep well ... echoing loudly!

ANGLE ON: GANDALF turns angrily on PIPPIN.

GANDALF (angrily)

Fool of a Took! Throw yourself in next time, and rid us of your stupidity!

ANGLE ON: PIPPIN, CHASTENED.

They fall silent. A low rolling BOOM rises from the depths below

... growing louder ... BOOM ... BOOM ... as if the caverns of MORIA were turned into a vast drum. A great horn blasts nearby

... ANSWERING horns ... running feet ... harsh cries ...

CLOSE ON: SAM’S eyes glance at FRODO’S belt...

SAM (worried)

Mr. Frodo!


(CONTINUED)
 
127.

CONTINUED: (2)

ANGLE ON: FRODO looks down. A cold blue glow is emanating from STING’S SCABBARD! FRODO draws the SWORD ... and stares at its glowing blade!

LEGOLAS

Orcs!

ARAGORN (to the Hobbits)
Get back! Stay close to Gandalf.

ARAGORN and BOROMIR slam and wedge the doors. BOROMIR catches sight of something; he turns to ARAGORN with shock in his eyes.

BOROMIR

They have a cave-troll!

ANGLE ON: GIMLI snatches up two rusty Dwarf axes and leaps onto the tomb.

GIMLI (yelling)

Let them come! There is one Dwarf yet in Moria who still draws breath!

BOOM! The door bursts open in a shower of wood fragments, and 20 GOBLINS charge into the tomb, followed by a HUGH CAVE TROLL!

ANGLES ON: GIMLI ducks a blow and immediately buries his AXES in 2 GOBLIN HELMETS. ARAGORN and BOROMIR wade into the mass of GOBLINS with their swords. LEGOLAS fires deadly arrows into GOBLIN throats, desperately trying to SHIELD the HOBBITS! GANDALF is clutching his sword, GLAMDRING, and joins in the battle!

ANGLES ON: The CAVE TROLL is sweeping his club at ARAGORN ...

who stumbles backwards ... the huge club descends for the killing blow ... SUDDENLY, in a FLASH OF STEEL, BOROMIR’S long sword SLICES into the SCALY ARM of the TROLL; it rears back,
SPEWING GREEN BLOOD!

ANGLES ON: SAM is backed up against a wall .. a sword in one hand, a SAUCEPAN in the other. In desperation he swings wildly at a GOBLIN with the saucepan! It keels over ... SAM looks surprised. He wallops another GOBLIN and it too, drops.

SAM

I think I’m getting the hang of this.

(CONTINUED)
 
128.

CONTINUED: (3)

ANGLE ON: The CAVE TROLL lunges forward, thrusting at FRODO’S chest with his spear.

FRODO
Aragorn! Aragorn!

SAM screams as FRODO is lifted off his feet by the spear tip and slammed against the wall.

ARAGORN (shocked yell)

Frodo!

ANGLES ON: The HOBBITS go crazy. SAM slashes at the CAVE TROLL’S knee, bringing him down ... MERRY and PIPPIN jump on him ...

LEGOLAS fires an arrow ... and the CAVE TROLL topples, dead.

ANGLE ON: ARAGORN rushes to FRODO’S side as he slumps to the floor ... FRODO appears to be dead.

CLOSE ON: GANDALF, ARAGORN, HOBBITS looking horrified...

SUDDENLY, FRODO coughs ... takes a huge breath.

SAM

He's alive.

FRODO

I'm all right. I'm not hurt.

ARAGORN

You should be dead. That spear would have skewered a wild boar.

GANDALF

I think there’s more to this Hobbit than meets the eye.

ANGLE ON: FRODO opens his shirt to reveal the MITHRIL VEST. The TROLL SPEAR did not pierce the MITHRIL.

GIMLI

Mithril! You are full of surprises,
Master Baggins.

BOOM. BOOM. BOOM. the sound of the drums rings out again! GANDALF turns to the other.

(CONTINUED)
 
129.

CONTINUED: (4)

GANDALF

To the bridge of Khazad-Dûm!

CUT TO:

INT. DWARROWDELF CHAMBER, MORIA - DAY

GANDALF leads the FELLOWSHIP into the huge DWARROWDELF CHAMBER.

GANDALF
This way!

They hurry towards a distant door ... as GOBLINS start scuttling down the PILLARS behind them, like cockroaches!

ANGLE ON: FRODO looks with horror at the overwhelming GOBLIN army that’s rushing towards them!

SUDDENLY! A deafening roar fills the air! A fiery light dances down the hallway ... the pillars castings eerie shadows.

ANGLES ON: The GOBLINS freeze. They back fearfully away from the approaching beast ... melting into the darkness.

BOROMIR

What is this new devilry?

A HUGE SHADOW, surrounded by FLAME, falls across the hall ...

the ground shakes ... an unearthly sound rumbles.

GANDALF (quietly)

A Balrog ... a demon of the ancient world! This foe is beyond any of you!

(urgent yell) Run! Quickly!

CUT TO:

INT. STAIRWAY OF KHAZAD-DÛM, MORIA - DAY

The BALROG, a massive creature rises from a chasm, a great 40-FOOT MAN-BEAST, with a MANE OF FLAMES! In one hand is a BLADE
... like a stabbing TONGUE OF FIRE; in the other, a WHIP of MANY

THONGS.

ANGLE ON: ARAGORN leads the FELLOWSHIP to the top of a dizzying stairway ... GANDALF follows, leaning heavily on his staff.

(CONTINUED)
 
130.

CONTINUED:

CLOSE ON: ARAGORN looks at GANDALF, concerned.

GANDALF

Lead them on, Aragorn! The bridge is near.

ARAGORN hesitates ... GANDALF looks at him.

GANDALF (CONT’D)

Do as I say; Swords are no more use
here.

The FELLOWSHIP race down the stairway.

ARAGORN picks up FRODO ... leaping across a gaping chasm ...

GANDALF yells to the others.

ANGLE ON: ARAGORN makes to throw GIMLI across the chasm.

GIMLI

Nobody tosses a dwarf!

The BALROG smashes through the wall and spreads its VAST WINGS. It swoops down past the FELLOWSHIP, disappearing into a FLAMING PIT!

CUT TO:

INT. BRIDGE OF KHAZAD-DÛM, MORIA - DAY

The FELLOWSHIP run into the SECOND HALL ... the floor is split with fissures that spit flame.

GANDALF (yelling)
Over the bridge! Fly!

They race towards the slender bridge of stone ... without kerb or rail ... at the far end of the hall. The FELLOWSHIP recklessly hurry over the dizzying bridge .. but GANDALF ... the last ... pauses in the middle of the span ... he faces the BALROG ... staff in one hand ... GLAMDRING in the other!

ANGLE ON: FRODO looks back in horror:

GANDALF (CONT’D)
You cannot pass!

(CONTINUED)
 
131.

CONTINUED:

FRODO (alarmed yell)
Gandalf!

GANDALF (yelling)

I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor. The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udûn.

FRODO watches as the BALROG puts one foot on the bridge and draws up to FULL HEIGHT, wings spreading from wall-to-wall. GANDALF is a tiny figure, balanced precariously on the narrow bridge.

GANDALF (CONT’D)
Go back to the Shadow!

The BALROG slashes at GANDALF with its SWORD OF FLAME ...

GANDALF blocks with GLAMDRING ... a ringing clash and the BALROG’S SWORD SHATTERS into MOLTEN FRAGMENTS!

GANDALF (booming)
You shall not pass!!

The BALROG places one foot onto the bridge.

ARAGORN

He cannot stand alone! Elendil! I am with you Gandalf!

BOROMIR (raising his sword)

Gondor!

ANGLE ON: ARAGORN and BOROMIR race forward, swords drawn.

GANDALF CRIES ALOUD as he summons his LAST RESERVES OF STRENGTH!!

He thumps the bridge with his staff ... a blinding sheet of white flame springs up ... the staff shatters ... the bridge breaks ... right at the BALROG’S feet.

The stone bridge drops away into the GULF ... from under the BALROG. For a moment, the great BEAST remains poised in the air

... then it plunges down:


(CONTINUED)
 
132.

CONTINUED: (2)

SLOW MOTION: RELIEF floods FRODO’S face ... GANDALF remains trembling on the lip of the broken bridge.

SLOW MOTION: As the BALROG falls, he lashes out with his whip of
fire...

SLOW MOTION: The thongs of the whip lash and curl around GANDALF’S knees, dragging him over the brink! GANDALF just manages to hang on by his fingertips.

FRODO (screaming)

Gandalf!

GANDALF (fierce)
Fly, you fools!

CLOSE ON: GANDALF lets go his grip and falls away ... following the BALROG into the BOTTOMLESS ABYSS!

FRODO cries out! BOROMIR scoops him up and carries him away!

FRODO
No!

ARAGORN
Gandalf!

They rush towards an archway.

CUT TO:

EXT. DIMRILL DALE DOOR - DAY

The FELLOWSHIP tumble out of the GREAT EASTERN GATE on to a grassy sunlit hillside. SAM, MERRY, and PIPPIN fall slowly to the ground, SOBBING ...

ANGLE ON: ARAGORN turns to LEGOLAS and GIMLI.

ARAGORN (urgent)
Legolas, get them up.

BOROMIR
Give them a moment ... for pity's sake!

(CONTINUED)
 
133.

CONTINUED:

ARAGORN

By nightfall these hills will be swarming with Orcs! We must reach the woods of Lothlórien. Come Boromir, Legolas, Gimli, get them up. On your feet, Sam.

ANGLE ON: BOROMIR glances towards FRODO, then back at ARAGORN.

ANGLE ON: FRODO is walking away, as if in a daze.

ARAGORN (CONT’D)

Frodo? Frodo!

CLOSE ON: FRODO SLOWLY TURNS ... a look of numb shock on his devastated face. The FELLOWSHIP marches on.

CUT TO:

EXT. DIMRILL DALE HILLSIDE - DUSK

ARAGORN scours ahead of the COMPANY, as they stumble on in the fading light ... in the distance the shimmer of a large forest can be seen ... LOTHLÓRIEN!

EXT. EDGE OF LOTHLÓRIEN - DUSK

WIDE ON: The FELLOWSHIP run across a forest floor strewn with YELLOW FLOWERS ... above is a ROOF OF GOLDEN LEAVES, held up by SILVER PILLARS ... the TRUNKS of HUGE, GREY TREES.

ANGLE ON: LEGOLAS, taking in the surroundings as if a return home.

LEGOLAS (musing)

Ah, Lothlórien. The fairest of all the dwellings of my people. There are no trees like the trees of this land, for in autumn the leaves fall not, but turn to gold. Not till the spring comes and the new green opens do they fall, and then the boughs are laden with yellow flowers; and the floor of the wood is golden, and golden is the roof, and its pillars are of silver, for the bark of the trees is smooth and grey. So still our songs in Mirkwood say.

(CONTINUED)
 
134.

CONTINUED:

ANGLE ON: In contrast, GIMLI looks nervously around...

GIMLI

Stay close, young Hobbits ... they say a great sorceress lives in these woods. An Elf-witch of terrible power. All who look upon her fall under her spell...

CLOSE ON: FRODO hesitates ... a STRANGE VOICE whispers in his

head...

GALADRIEL (V.O.)

Frodo...

GIMLI

And are never seen again!

GALADRIEL (V.O.)

...your coming to us is as the footsteps of doom. You bring great evil here, Ring-bearer.

SAM

Mr. Frodo?

GIMLI

Well, here’s one Dwarf she won't ensnare so easily. I have the eyes of a hawk and the ears of a fox!

The FELLOWSHIP are suddenly surrounded by ARMED ELVES. DEADLY ARROWS are aimed at their heads. HALDIR, the ELVISH CAPTAIN, steps forward...

HALDIR

The Dwarf breathes so loud we could have shot him in the dark.

CUT TO:

INT. CERIN AMROTH, LOTHLÓRIEN - NIGHT

Night is deepening amongst the windy trees. The FELLOWSHIP stands on a platform in the trees. HALDIR greets them.


(CONTINUED)
 
135.

Mae govannen, Legolas Thranduilion.

Welcome Legolas, son of Thranduil.

LEGOLAS
(Elvish; with subtitles)

Govannas vîn gwennen le, Haldir o Lórien.

Our Fellowship stands in your debt,

Haldir of Lórien.

ANGLE ON: HALDIR glances at ARAGORN.

HALDIR
(Elvish; with subtitles)

A, Aragorn in Dúnedain istannen le ammen.

Oh, Aragorn of the Dúnedain, you are known to us.

ARAGORN
Haldir.

GIMLI

So much for the legendary courtesy of the Elves! Speak words we can also understand!

HALDIR
We have not had dealings with the

Dwarves since the Dark Days.

GIMLI

And you know what this Dwarf says to that? Ishkhaqwi ai durugnul!

I spit on your grave!

ANGLE ON: ARAGORN takes GIMLI by the arm.

ARAGORN (stern)
That was not so courteous.

HALDIR moves on to FRODO.

(CONTINUED)
 
136.

CONTINUED: (2)

HALDIR

You bring great evil with you. (to ARAGORN)

You can go no further.

HALDIR walks away.

ANGLE ON: SAM and PIPPIN turn to look at FRODO. FRODO appears uncomfortable.

LATER...

The FELLOWSHIP sit while ARAGORN speaks with HALDIR.

ARAGORN

Boe ammen veriad lîn. Andelu i ven!

We need your protection. The road is fell!

HALDIR whispers back inaudibly.

ARAGORN

Merin le telim.

I wish we may come with you.

HALDIR answers quietly, again so that only ARAGORN can hear his words.

ARAGORN

Henio, aníron boe ammen i dulu lîn!

Please, understand, we need your support!

ANGLE ON: FRODO looks to the remainder of the FELLOWSHIP. As they meet his eyes, they look away, as if he has become a scourge to them.

ANGLE ON: ARAGORN continues to argue loudly with HALDIR.

ANGLE ON: FRODO, looking at his friends, sees blame that does not truly exist anywhere but in his mind. He is alone, it seems.

ANGLE ON: ARAGORN pleads with HALDIR.

(CONTINUED)
 
137.

CONTINUED: (3)

ARAGORN

Andelu i ven.

The road is very dangerous.

ANGLE ON: BOROMIR approaches FRODO.

BOROMIR

Gandalf's death was not in vain. nor would he have you give up hope. You carry a heavy burden, Frodo. Don't carry the weight of the dead.

HALDIR stands before FRODO.

HALDIR

Very well. Here we will stay awhile, and come to the city of Galadhrim on the morrow.

INT. CERIN AMROTH, LOTHLÓRIEN - DAY

ANGLE ON: SAM and FRODO sit on one of the many platforms in the trees at CERIN AMROTH. SAM suddenly looks up and around, with a puzzled expression. He rubs his eyes.

FRODO
What is it?

SAM

It’s an odd thing, Mr. Frodo. It’s sunlight and bright day, right enough. I thought that Elves were all for moon and stars. But this is more Elvish than anything I ever heard tell of. I feel as if I was inside a song, if you take my meaning.

HALDIR (from behind them)

You feel the power of the Lady of Galadhrim. Would it please you to climb with me up Cerin Amroth?

WIDE ON: FRODO and SAM follow HALDIR up a long series of platforms until they reach the pinnacle of the trees.


(CONTINUED)
 
138.

CONTINUED:

ANGLE ON: FRODO and SAM approach the edge of a high platform and look out in wonder.

HIGH WIDE SHOT: MIDDLE EARTH stretches out for miles and miles to the NORTH. Far to the NORTH, a shadow lingers over the FOREST

OF MIRKWOOD.

ANGLE ON: HALDIR points the HOBBITS’ gaze to the dark cloud.

HALDIR

There lies the fastness of Southern Mirkwood. It is clad in a forest of dark fir, where the trees strive one against another and their branches rot and whither. In the midst upon a stony height stands Dol Guldur, where long the hidden Enemy had his dwelling. We fear that now it is inhabited again, and with power sevenfold. A black cloud lies often over it of late.

PAN ON WIDE SHOT: From ORTHANC to the WEST across the magnificent view to MORDOR and BARAD-DÛR in the EAST.

HALDIR (CONT’D)

In this high place you may see the two powers that are oppose one to another; and ever they strive now in thought, but whereas the light perceives the very heart of the darkness, its own secret has not been discovered. Not yet.

ANGLE ON: HALDIR leaves the high place. With a final look, FRODO and SAM follow.

INT. CERIN AMROTH, LOTHLÓRIEN - DAY

CLOSE ON: A SMALL GOLDEN FLOWER in someone’s hand.

ANGLE ON: ARAGORN, admiring the beauty of this flower.

ARAGORN
Arwen vanimelda, namárië.

ANGLE ON: FRODO approaches. ARAGORN sighs, and then turns to FRODO and smiles.

(CONTINUED)
 
139.

CONTINUED:

ARAGORN

Here is the heart of Elvendom on earth, and here my heart dwells ever, unless there be a light beyond the dark roads that we still must tread, you and I.

FRODO

Do you believe we may yet succeed in our quest?

ARAGORN

We shall endure to the last.

CUT TO:

EXT. LOTHLÓRIEN HILLTOP - DAY

HALDIR leads the FELLOWSHIP onto a HILL TOP. They look with wonderment at the vista spread before them.

WIDE ON: Several miles towards the SOUTH, a LARGE HILL rises out of the woods. Upon the hill rise many mighty MALLORN TREES, taller than any others ... NESTLED high in the crown of the mallorns is a BEAUTIFUL CITY. It GLEAMS in the low rays of the late afternoon ... green, gold, and silver. To the east of CARAS GALADHON, the WOODS of LÓRIEN run down the pale gleam of ANDUIN, the great river.

Beyond the RIVER, the land appears flat and empty, formless and vague, until far away, it rises again like a dark dreary wall. The SUN that lies on LOTHLÓRIEN has not power to enlighten the shadows that lie beyond.

HALDIR

Caras Galadon. The heart of Elvendom on earth. This is the city of Galadhrim where dwell the Lord Celeborn and of Galadriel, Lady of Light.

CUT TO:

EXT. CELEBORN’S CHAMBER, CARAS GALADHON - NIGHT

ANGLE ON: THE FELLOWSHIP step onto a wide fleet filled with a soft light. The walls are green and silver, the roof gold and in its midst is the trunk of the mighty MALLORN TREE, now tapering toward its crown.

(CONTINUED)
 
140.

CONTINUED:

ANGLE ON: CELEBORN steps forward to greet the guests. His hair is long and silver, his face grave and beautiful, with no sign of age upon it. Next to him stands GALADRIEL, the LADY OF THE ELVES. She has hair of deep gold and timeless unsurpassed beauty.

ANGLE ON: CELEBORN looks hard at ARAGORN...

CELEBORN

The enemy knows you have entered here. What hope you had in secrecy is now gone. Eight there are here, yet nine there were set out from Rivendell. Tell me, where is Gandalf? For I much desire to speak with him. I can no longer see him from afar.

ANGLE ON: FRODO looks at GALADRIEL, standing silently beside
CELEBORN.

GALADRIEL (softly aloud)

Gandalf the Grey did not pass the borders of this land. He has fallen into Shadow.

LEGOLAS

He was taken by both Shadow and flame. A Balrog of Morgoth. For we went needlessly into the net of Moria.

ANGLE ON: The FELLOWSHIP bow their heads in sadness at the memory of GANDALF.

ANGLE ON: CELEBORN appears surprised.

GALADRIEL

Needless were none of the deeds of Gandalf in life. We do not yet know his full purpose.

GALADRIEL surveys the face of the FELLOWSHIP.

CLOSE ON: GIMLI looks up as GALADRIEL addresses him.


(CONTINUED)
 
141.

CONTINUED: (2)

GALADRIEL

Do not let the great emptiness of Khazad-dûm fill your heart Gimli, son of Glóin. For the world has grown full of peril, and in all lands, love is now mingled with grief.

ANGLE ON: GALADRIEL looks over he FELLOWSHIP again to meet her gaze with BOROMIR’S.

CLOSE ON: BOROMIR is suddenly fearful and nervous.

CLOSE ON: GALADRIEL’S eyes piercing BOROMIR.

ANGLE ON: BOROMIR turns away from her.

ANGLE ON: GALADRIEL’S gaze remains on him for a moment before turning to CELEBORN.

CELEBORN

What now becomes of this Fellowship?
Without Gandalf, hope is lost.

ANGLE ON: GALADRIEL looks to ARAGORN.

GALADRIEL

The quest stands upon the edge of a knife. Stray but a little and it will fail, to the ruin of all... Yet hope remains while the company is true.

GALADRIEL’S eyes settle on SAM.

GALADRIEL

Do not let your hearts be troubled. Go now and rest, for you are weary with sorrow and much toil.

GALADRIEL’S eyes turn to FRODO ... her voice fades.

GALADRIEL

Tonight you will sleep in peace. (whispered v/o)
Welcome, Frodo of the Shire...

CLOSE ON: FRODO looks at GALADRIEL.


(CONTINUED)
 
142.

CONTINUED: (3)

SUDDEN INSERT: GALADRIEL as she is on the other side ...

POWERFUL, DIVINE ... no longer of this world ... a PIERCING white light surrounds her.


GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT’D)

...one who has seen the eye.

CUT TO:

EXT. CARAS GALADON, LOTHLÓRIEN - NIGHT

GIMLI, LEGOLAS, MERRY, PIPPIN, FRODO, and SAM are in a pavilion set among the trees near the fountain. They lie on soft couches as ELVES leave food and wine for them. MOURNFUL SINGING drifts down from the trees above.

LEGOLAS (sadly)

A lament for Gandalf...

MERRY

What do they say about him?

LEGOLAS

I have not the heart to tell you. For me, the grief is still too near.

ANGLE ON: FRODO lies on his bed watching the others. SAM works with PIPPIN.

SAM

I bet they don’t mention his fireworks. There should be a verse about them.

ANGLE ON: SAM stands up to add his own verse to the ELVEN SONG.

SAM

The finest rockets ever seen

They burst in stars of blue and green
Or after thunder, silver showers

Come falling like a rain of flowers.

Oh, that doesn’t do them justice by a long road.

SAM sits down, frustrated and disappointed with himself.

(CONTINUED)
 
143.

ANGLE ON: BOROMIR is sitting alone ... ARAGORN approaches him.


ARAGORN

Take some rest. These borders are well protected.

ANGLE ON: Moonlight catches the trace of tears on BOROMIR’S face. ARAGORN kneels beside him.

BOROMIR

I will find no rest here. I heard her voice inside my head. She spoke of my father and the fall of Gondor. She said to me, “Even now, there is hope left.” But I cannot see it ... it is long since we had any hope.

CLOSE ON: BOROMIR looks at ARAGORN in despair.

BOROMIR (CONT’D)

My father is a noble man, but his rule is failing, and our ... our people lose faith. He looks to me to make things right ... and I would do it, I would see the glory of Gondor restored. Have you ever seen it, Aragorn? The White Tower of Ecthelion, glimmering like a spike of pearl and silver, its banners caught high in the morning breeze ...

have you ever been called home by the clear ringing of silver trumpets?

ARAGORN

I have seen the White City ... long ago.

BOROMIR feels ARAGORN’S love for MINAS TIRITH and takes heart.

BOROMIR

One day, our paths will lead us there, and the tower guard will take up the call “the Lords of Gondor have returned.”

ARAGORN returns BOROMIR’S smile ... betraying his disquiet sadness only when BOROMIR looks away.
 
144.

LATER...

The FELLOWSHIP are asleep on their beds. GIMLI is snoring loudly.

CLOSE ON: BARE FEET treads soundlessly across the lawn.

CLOSE ON: FRODO’S EYES FLICKER OPEN ... as if by instinct.

ANGLE ON: GALADRIEL, her WHITE dress glowing in the moonlight, glances at him. FRODO follows her ... as if drawn by an invisible force.

EXT. GALADRIEL’S GLADE, LOTHLÓRIEN - NIGHT

Upon a low stone pedestal, carved like a branching tree, sits a shallow SILVER BASIN. GALADRIEL leads FRODO into the small

GLADE.

GALADRIEL
Will you look into the mirror?

ANGLE ON: FRODO looks with apprehension at the silver basin.

FRODO (warily)
What will I see?

GALADRIEL pours water into the basin from a silver jug ... a GLOW rises from the water.

GALADRIEL

Even the wisest cannot tell. For the mirror shows many things ... things that were ... things that are ... and some things that have not yet come to pass.

FRODO slowly steps up to the PEDESTAL ... he peers into the glossy surface. The night sky is reflected in the water ...

suddenly a figure takes form ... the bowed figure of an OLD MAN, CLAD IN WHITE ROBES. He walks down a long road. FRODO leans closer to the mirror’s surface.

CLOSE ON: GANDALF LIFTS HIS HEAD AND LOOKS DIRECTLY AT FRODO!

FRODO gasps, his face lighting up with hope.

FRODO (joyous)

Gandalf!

(CONTINUED)
 
145.

CONTINUED:

GANDALF looks at FRODO with a fierce intensity. FRODO reaches out his hand toward the surface of the mirror. Suddenly the image flares, burning out to white.

THE VISION SHIFTS ... FRODO gasps in horror! The SHIRE is in ruins!

THE IMAGE SUDDENLY WIDENS TO FILL THE SCREEN ... buildings burning ... bodies strewn about ... DARK SHAPES of ORCS looting and destroying ... BAG END, billowing in flames! The Party Tree is hacked down.

ANGLE ON: FRODO reels back as the mirror seems to grow. The nightmarish image sweeps past his head, engulfing him entirely.

IMAGE: HOBBITON ... now an INDUSTRIAL WASTELAND. The fields and trees destroyed ... replaced with BRICK FACTORIES belching smoke!

IMAGE: ORCS brutally herd manacled HOBBITS into the FACTORIES! We see SAM ... MERRY ... and ROSIE COTTON. SOOT-STAINED and SOBBING, they disappear into the factory hellhole!

SUDDENLY, the mirror goes dark ... and out of the black abyss a
SINGLE EYE GROWS.

CLOSE ON: FRODO IS FROZEN. Unable to move or cry out. The RING dangles from his neck, inches above the water ... not shimmering with curls of steam. FIRE erupts around the EYE.

WITH A YELL, FRODO pushes himself away from the pedestal and collapses on the ground. Light instantly fades from the mirror. FRODO comes to his senses ... he is shocked.

ANGLE ON: GALADRIEL stands still as a statue, unmoved, untouched by the horror.

GALADRIEL

I know what it is you saw ... for it is also in my mind. It is the future, Frodo. It is what will come to pass if you should fail.

GALADRIEL looks at FRODO intensely ... FRODO looks down ... in his hand he is clutching the RING. FRODO looks up at GALADRIEL.


(CONTINUED)
 
146.

CONTINUED: (2)

GALADRIEL (CONT’D) The Fellowship is breaking. It is

already begun. He will try to take the Ring. You know of whom I speak. One by one, it will destroy them all.

FRODO (V.O.)

If you ask it of me, I will give you the One Ring.

GALADRIEL

You offer it to me freely ... I do not deny that my heart has greatly desired this.

GALADRIEL suddenly seems to rise in stature before FRODO’S eyes. FRODO is suddenly afraid of her.

GALADRIEL

In place of the Dark Lord, you would have a Queen, not dark, but beautiful and terrible as the Dawn. Treacherous as the Sea! Stronger than the foundations of the earth ... All shall love me and despair!

ANGLE ON: FRODO takes a step away from GALADRIEL...

ANGLE ON: GALADRIEL suddenly laughs ... a slender ELF-WOMAN once more, clad in simple white, her voice soft and sad.

GALADRIEL (CONT’D) (gently)

I pass the test. (laughs)

I will diminish, and go into the West, and remain Galadriel.

ANGLE ON: FRODO’S confidence drains away.

FRODO
I cannot do this alone.

GALADRIEL

You are a Ring-bearer, Frodo. To bear a

Ring of Power is to be alone.


(CONTINUED)
 
147.

CONTINUED: (3)

CLOSE ON: GALADRIEL raises her hand to show FRODO her own RING.

GALADRIEL (CONT’D)

This is Nenya, the Ring of Adamant. And
I am its keeper.

GALADRIEL lowers her hand, hiding NENYA once more.

GALADRIEL (CONT’D) This task was appointed to you. And
if you do not find a way, no one will.

ANGLE ON: FRODO realizes what her message is.

FRODO

Then I know what I must do. It's just I’m afraid to do it.

GALADRIEL kneels down to FRODO’S height, staring at him intently.

GALADRIEL

Even the smallest person can change the course of the future.

CLOSE ON: THE RING lies in the palm of FRODO’S hand ... his fingers close over it.

CUT TO:

INT. ORTHANC CHAMBER - DAY

NAKED, LURTZ’S eyes follow SARUMAN, alight with a mean intelligence.

SARUMAN (smiles)

Do you know how Orcs first came into being? They were Elves once. Taken by the Dark Powers ... tortured and mutilated ... a ruined and terrible form of life. And now perfected. My fighting Uruk-Hai. Whom do you serve?

LURTZ (guttural rasp)
Saruman.
 
148.

INT. CAVERNS BELOW ISENGARD - DAY

QUICK CUTS: LURTZ is quickly armored ... BREASTPLATE ... LEG GUARDS, HELMET ... a sword is thrust in LURTZ’S hand. The URUK-HAI are smearing themselves in white paint ... a creepy ritualistic ceremony ... the WHITE HAND OF ISENGARD is smeared on bodies, faces, and armor.

ANGLE ON: SARUMAN addresses a crowd of 200 fully-armed URUK-HAI.

SARUMAN

Hunt them down. Do not stop until they are found. You do not know pain. You do not know fear. You will taste man-flesh.

SARUMAN turns to LURTZ.

SARUMAN (CONT’D) (coldly)

One of the Halflings carries something of great value ... bring them to me ...

alive and unspoiled ... kill the others.

EXT. ISENGARD - DAY

LURTZ is leading 200 URUK-HAI out of ISENGARD ... they run fast, their powerful legs carrying them at speed.

EXT. SILVERLODE RIVER BANK - DAWN

The mists of morning lay heavily along the river. Bare-branched trees arch through the fogs, stray beams of light falling on the cold, blue waters.

ANGLE ON: GALADRIEL approaches the bank in an elegant ship, carved in the likeness of a swan.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. SILVERLODE SHORE, LOTHLÓRIEN - DAWN

CLOSE ON: An green, silver-veined ELVEN LEAF-BROOCH is clasped.

ANGLE ON: ELVES clasp ELVEN CLOAKS around on the FELLOWSHIP, each with a leaf-brooch.

CELEBORN (V.O.)

Never before have we clad strangers in the garb of our own people.

(CONTINUED)
 
149.

CONTINUED:

ANGLE ON: CELEBORN addresses the FELLOWSHIP.

CELEBORN (CONT’D)

May these cloaks help shield you from unfriendly eyes.

EXT. SILVERLODE RIVER BANK, LOTHLÓRIEN - DAWN

ANGLE ON: LEGOLAS grabs a couple of packs and puts them in an Elven boat. MERRY and PIPPIN look up as he pulls a small piece of bread from one of the packs.

LEGOLAS
Lembas. Elvish waybread.

He takes a bite.

LEGOLAS

One small bite is enough to fill the stomach of a grown Man.

He stuffs the remaining piece back in the pack and places it in the boats.

ANGLE ON: MERRY and PIPPIN nod as he walks away.

MERRY
How many did you eat?

PIPPIN

Four.

MERRY nods and picks at his teeth. PIPPIN belches.

ANGLES ON: The FELLOWSHIP continue to load the boats for their journey ... LEGOLAS helps GIMLI into a boat ... SAM crawls into another boat and quickly reveals he has no measure of sea legs.

CELEBORN (V.O.)

Every league you travel south, the danger will increase. Mordor Orcs now hold the eastern shore of the Anduin. Nor will you find safety on the western bank.
 
150.

EXT. SILVERLODE SHORE, LOTHLÓRIEN - DAWN

ANGLE ON: CELEBORN and ARAGORN walks toward the RIVER.

CELEBORN

Strange creatures bearing the White Hand have been seen on our borders.

Seldom do Orcs journey in the open

under the sun, yet these have done so.

CLOSE ON: CELEBORN holds a DAGGER out the ARAGORN. ARAGORN takes the dagger and unsheathes it. It is a beautiful, yet deadly work of art.

CELEBORN (Elvish; subtitled)

Le aphadar aen.

You are being tracked.

ANGLE ON: ARAGORN replaces the dagger in its sheath.

CELEBORN

By river you have the chance of outrunning the enemy to the Falls of Rauros.

EXT. SILVERLODE RIVER BANK - DAWN

The FELLOWSHIP are in three small ELVEN BOATS. ELVES quietly watch them depart.

CLOSE ON: LEGOLAS, remembering...

GALADRIEL (V.O.)

My gift for you, Legolas, is a bow of the Galadhrim. Worthy of the skill of our woodland kin.

INSERT FLASHBACK

ANGLE ON: LEGOLAS lifts an elegant BOW and tests its strength.

ANGLE ON: GALADRIEL smiles and walks to MERRY and PIPPIN.

ANGLE ON: MERRY removes a dagger from its sheathe and gazes upon it.


(CONTINUED)
 
151.

CONTINUED:

GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT’D)

These are the daggers of the Noldorin.
They have already seen service in war.

ANGLE ON: PIPPIN looks upon his gift with the fear he may have to use it. He casts his eyes upon GALADRIEL.

GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT’D)

Do not fear, young Peregrin Took.

You will find your courage.

END FLASHBACK

CLOSE ON: MERRY and PIPPIN ride expressionless in their boat.

CLOSE ON: SAM, remembering...

GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT’D) And for you, Samwise Gamgee, Elven rope made of hithlain.

INSERT FLASHBACK

ANGLE ON: SAM bows to her, accepting his gift.

SAM

Thank you, my lady.

He looks at MERRY and PIPPIN, and then back to GALADRIEL.

SAM (hesitantly)

Have you run out of those nice, shiny daggers?

GALADRIEL smiles, and SAM holds onto his rope, embarrassed. She moves on to GIMLI, who stares at the ground in her presence.

GALADRIEL

And what gift would a Dwarf ask of the

Elves?

ANGLE ON: GIMLI shakes his head quickly.

GIMLI

Nothing.

He looks up at her.

(CONTINUED)
 
152.

CONTINUED: (2)

GIMLI (CONT’D)

Except to look upon the lady of the Galadhrim one last time for she is

more fair than all the jewels beneath the earth.

ANGLE ON: GALADRIEL laughs. GIMLI scowls at his foolishness and turns away. He recovers and turns back to her.

GIMLI (CONT’D) Actually... There was one thing. No, no, I couldn’t. It’s quite impossible. Stupid to ask.

END FLASHBACK

CLOSE ON: GIMLI rides silently before LEGOLAS. He closes his eyes, allowing the memory to flood into his head.

CLOSE ON: ARAGORN, remembering...

INSERT FLASHBACK

ANGLE ON: GALADRIEL stands before ARAGORN.

GALADRIEL

I have nothing greater to give than the gift you already bear.

CLOSE ON: She touches the EVENSTAR PENDANT ARAGORN wears.

GALADRIEL (CONT’D) (in Elvish; subtitled)

Am meleth dîn. I ant e-guil Arwen Undómiel ... pelitha.

For her love, I fear the grace of

Arwen Evenstar ... will diminish.

ARAGORN

(in Elvish; subtitled) Aníron i e broniatha ar periatham amar hen. Aníron e ciratha a Valannor.

I would have her leave these shores, and be with her people. I would have her take the ship to Valinor.

(CONTINUED)
 
153.

CONTINUED: (3)

GALADRIEL

That choice is yet before her. You have your own choice to make, Aragorn.

ANGLE ON: ARAGORN straightens before her.

GALADRIEL (CONT’D)

To rise above the height of all your fathers since the days of Elendil or to fall into darkness with all that is left of your kin.

Silence follows ... branches shake ... a spider web’s glimmering strands sway in the wind.

ANGLE ON: GALADRIEL glances at the pendant, and smiles.

GALADRIEL (CONT’D) (in Elvish; subtitled)

Namárië.

Farewell.

ANGLE ON: ARAGORN bows to her and turns to leave. GALADRIEL stops him.

GALADRIEL (CONT’D) (in Elvish; subtitled)

Nadath nâ i moe cerich. Dan ...
ú-'eveditham, Elessar.

There is much you have yet to do.
We shall not meet again, Elessar.

END FLASHBACK

CLOSE ON: FRODO rides at the head of his boat.

GALADRIEL (V.O.)

Farewell, Frodo Baggins.

INSERT FLASHBACK

GALADRIEL gives FRODO a small CRYSTAL PHIAL.

GALADRIEL (CONT’D)

I give you the light of Eärendil, our most beloved star.

(CONTINUED)
 
154.

CONTINUED: (4)

GALADRIEL leans over and kisses his head.

END FLASHBACK

As the FELLOWSHIP’S boats drift past, GALADRIEL stands alone, watching from the banks of the river. In his head, FRODO still hears her voice...

GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT’D) May it be a light for you in dark places, when all other lights go out.

CLOSE ON: GIMLI riding at the head of his boat, paddled by
LEGOLAS.

GIMLI

I have taken my worst wound at this parting having looked my last upon

that which is fairest. Henceforth I will call nothing fair unless it be her gift to me.

LEGOLAS

What was her gift?

GIMLI

I asked her for one hair from her golden head. She gave me three.

CLOSE ON: LEGOLAS smiles.

EXT. RIVER ANDUIN - DAY

The boats pass into the GREAT RIVER ANDUIN. The THREE ELVEN boats carry the FELLOWSHIP steadily southward. GREEN TREES slowly give way to a brown and withered land.

EXT. FOREST - DAY

The URUK forces are running through the trees with deadly purpose.

EXT. RIVER ANDUIN - DAY

A flock of birds circle high above, BLACK against the PALE SKY. ARAGORN watches them with concern.
 
155.

EXT. RIVER ANDUIN BANKS - NIGHT

The THREE BOATS are safely stored on the bank out of the water.

ANGLE ON: BOROMIR hides behind a rock watching the river.

CLOSE ON: A LOG floats down the river. A HAND grasps the log and pulls itself onto it. Who or whatever it is seems to be trying to remain concealed from the eyes of the FELLOWSHIP.

ANGLE ON: ARAGORN approaches from behind BOROMIR.

ARAGORN

Gollum. He has tracked us since

Moria.

GOLLUM’S POV: GOLLUM watches the BOROMIR and ARAGORN stand behind the ROCK.

ANGLE ON: The log runs into a rock on the opposite side of the river and stops.

ARAGORN (O.S.)

I had hoped we would lose him on the river.

ANGLE ON: ARAGORN and BOROMIR continue watching GOLLUM.

ARAGORN (CONT’D)
But he’s too clever a waterman.

BOROMIR

And if he alerts the enemy to our whereabouts, it will make the crossing even more dangerous.

ANGLE ON: FRODO listens to the exchange between ARAGORN and BOROMIR. He looks worried.

SAM (O.S.)
Have some food, Mr. Frodo.

FRODO
No, Sam.

SAM

You haven’t eaten anything all day. You’re not sleeping, neither. Don’t think I haven’t noticed.

(CONTINUED)
 
156.

ANGLE ON: SAM moves from the campfire to sit with FRODO.

SAM

Mr. Frodo-

FRODO
I’m all right.

SAM
But you’re not. I’m here to help you.

I promised Gandalf that I would.

CLOSE ON: FRODO looks at SAM, sadly, with the full weight of the knowledge of what he must do.

FRODO

You can’t help me, Sam. Not this time.

Get some sleep.

FRODO turns away from SAM and returns to his own thoughts. Reluctantly, SAM concedes and leaves FRODO alone.

ANGLE ON: BOROMIR turns away from the rock to ARAGORN.

BOROMIR

Minas Tirith is the safer road. You know that. From there we can regroup. Strike out for Mordor from a place
of strength.

ARAGORN

There is no strength in Gondor that can avail us.

BOROMIR

You were quick enough to trust the

Elves.

ARAGORN doesn’t respond, but listens impatiently.

BOROMIR (CONT’D) (desperately)

Have you so little faith in your own people? Yes, there is weakness. There is frailty. But there is courage also, and honor to be found in Men. But you will not see that.

ANGLE ON: ARAGORN turns away from BOROMIR. BOROMIR grabs ARAGORN’S tunic, and turns ARAGORN to him.

(CONTINUED)
 
157.

CONTINUED: (2)

BOROMIR (CONT’D)

You are afraid!

ANGLE ON: FRODO listens intently to BOROMIR arguing with
ARAGORN.

BOROMIR (O.S.) (CONT’D) All your life, you have hidden in the shadows.

ANGLE ON: ARAGORN calmly listens to BOROMIR’S ravings.

BOROMIR (CONT’D) Scared of who you are, of what you are.

ARAGORN adjusts his tunic and turns away from BOROMIR. BOROMIR is speechless. ARAGORN turns back to him.

ARAGORN

I will not lead the Ring within a hundred leagues of your city.

CUT TO:

EXT. RIVER ANDUIN - DAY

ANGLE ON: BOROMIR, still feeling the defeat from the previous evening, paddles down the river along with the rest of the FELLOWSHIP. He glances scathingly towards ARAGORN.

ANGLE ON: ARAGORN refuses to return his glance.

EXT. PILLARS OF THE KINGS, RIVER ANDUIN - DAY

The THREE ELVEN boats drift slowly through the steep rocky gorge in the PRE-DAWN light.

CLOSE ON: ARAGORN, slowly paddling in the stern.

ARAGORN (quietly)

Frodo.

FRODO slowly looks up, his eyes widening with amazement.


(CONTINUED)
 
158.

CONTINUED:

WIDE ON: TWO ENORMOUS ROCK STATUES, towering like 300 foot pinnacles on either side of the river ... carved images of GONDORIAN KINGS of old. They loom over the boats with power and majesty.

ARAGORN (CONT’D)

The Argonath...

CLOSE ON: ARAGORN ... strangely moved by the beauty of the silent sentinels. He speaks, almost as if to himself.

ARAGORN (CONT’D)

Long have I desired to look upon the kings of old ... my kin.

The FELLOWSHIP stare in stunned silence as the current takes them through the narrow gap at the STATUES’ feet.

WIDE ON: CRANING UP past the statues vast crumbling heads, to

REVEAL a LARGE LAKE only a mile down river...

EXT. SHORE OF NEN HITHOEL - DAY

ANGLE ON: THE FELLOWSHIP as they leap out of the boats and clamber onto the wooded shore.

ARAGORN

We cross the lake at nightfall, hide the boats and continue on foot ... we approach Mordor from the North.

GIMLI (gloomy)

Oh, yes, just a simple matter of finding our way through Emyn Muil, an impassable labyrinth of razor-sharp rocks. And after that, it gets even better ... a festering, stinking marshland as far as the eye can see.

ARAGORN

That is our road. I suggest you take some rest and recover your strength, Master Dwarf.

GIMLI (indignant)

Recover my...

(CONTINUED)
 
159.

CONTINUED:

ANGLE ON: LEGOLAS turns to ARAGORN with urgency.

LEGOLAS

We should leave now.

ARAGORN

No. Orcs patrol the eastern shore. We must wait for cover of darkness.

LEGOLAS

It is not the Eastern shore that worries me.

LEGOLAS casts a glance around into the PARTH GALEN forest...

LEGOLAS

A shadow and a threat has been growing in my mind. Something draws near, I can feel it.

ARAGORN looks at LEGOLAS, knowing full well what he means.

ANGLE ON: SAM has slumped asleep. MERRY dumps a small pile of

kindling at GIMLI’S feet....

MERRY

Where’s Frodo?

SAM sits up with a start ... ARAGORN’S head snaps around. His eyes fly to BOROMIR’S shield which lies abandoned by his camp bed.

CLOSE ON: ARAGORN ... as he realizes BOROMIR has gone!

EXT. SLOPES OF AMON HEN - DAY

FRODO is walking beneath the trees ... lost in thought. His feet hit the rough edge of an ancient stone slab ... his eyes follow an overgrown path towards stone stairs leading to the SUMMIT OF AMON HEN ... the seeing seat.

A CRACKLING SOUND! FRODO freezes...

BOROMIR (quietly)

None of us should wander alone; you least of all. So much depends on you

... Frodo?

(CONTINUED)
 
160.

CONTINUED:

ANGLE ON: FRODO turns slowly ... he stares at BOROMIR, tense, cautious.

BOROMIR

I know why you seek solitude. You suffer, I see it day by day. Are you sure you do not suffer needlessly?

FRODO stands silent for a moment ... the murmur of the WIND in the trees and the distant roar of the FALLS OF RAUROS can be heard.

BOROMIR

Let me help you. There are other ways, Frodo ... other paths that we might take.

FRODO

I know what you would say, and it would sound like wisdom but for the warning of my heart.

BOROMIR

Warning? Against what?

BOROMIR has started forward towards FRODO. FRODO backs away from him.

BOROMIR (CONT’D)

We’re all afraid, Frodo. But to let that fear drive us to destroy what hope we have ... don't you see that is madness?

FRODO
There is no other way.

BOROMIR

I ask only for the strength to defend my people.

(angrily drops the wood he has collected)

If you would but lend me the Ring...

FRODO

No...

FRODO steps hurriedly away from BOROMIR.

(CONTINUED)
 
161.

CONTINUED: (2)

BOROMIR

Why do you recoil? I am no thief.

FRODO
(wary)

You are not yourself.

BOROMIR

What chance do you think you have? They will find you, they will take the Ring and you will beg for death before the end.

FRODO turns to leave.

BOROMIR (CONT’D)

You fool! It is not yours, save by unhappy chance. It might have been mine! It should be mine! Give it to me! Give me the Ring.

BOROMIR leaps on top of FRODO, grasping for the RING! FRODO has only moments to act. FRODO rips the RING from around his neck

... and rams it on his finger.

FRODO DISAPPEARS.

BOROMIR spins wildly around, yelling into thin air!

BOROMIR

I see your mind ... you will take the Ring to Sauron. You will betray us! You go to your death and the death of us all! Curse you! Curse you and all your Halflings!

BOROMIR stumbles and falls. His body shakes as if in the THROES of a fit ... slowly, he comes to.

BOROMIR (CONT’D) (disoriented)

Frodo! Frodo! What have I done? Please, Frodo...
 
162.

EXT. SEEING SEAT - DAY

IN THE TWILIGHT WORLD: FRODO races through the misty Twilight world, past the foggy shapes of twisted trees. Somewhere behind him, Boromir’s distraught voice carries, as if from another dimension.

BOROMIR (O.S.)

I’m sorry, Frodo ... Frodo...

FRODO suddenly finds himself on the stone steps ... he clambers up the stairs, onto a high seat, perched on four stone pillars. FRODO cowers on the seat, like a lost child upon the throne of mountain kings. The world of mist swirls around him.

FRODO peers out from the seat ... the world seems to shrink. In all directions, VIEWS of far off lands TELESCOPE towards him through the mist.

IMAGES: ORCS spilling out of holes in the MISTY MOUNTAINS ...

FLAMES rise from MIRKWOOD ... Grim faced EASTERLINGS march to war ... BLACK SHIPS sail to the South. All the power of the Dark Lord is in motion.

FRODO moves his gaze to the East ... FIRE explodes against the smoke, as a huge mass of black battlements fills Frodo’s vision. A mountain of iron, immeasurably strong, tower of adamant: BARAD-DÛR, the fortress of SAURON.

SUDDENLY! SAURON’S EYE LEAPS TOWARD FRODO LIKE A FINGER OF

LIGHT.

SAURON (V.O.)

(IN BLACK SPEECH) They will fall!

ANGLE ON: FRODO leaps off the seat, and tumbles down the stairs! The EYE sweeps AMON HEN like a searchlight, seeking its RING! With a huge effort, FRODO wrenches the RING off his finger...

EXT. SUMMIT OF AMON HEN - DAY

FRODO lies gasping on the SUMMIT OF AMON HEN ... below the ancient ruins of the seeing seat.

AT THAT MOMENT: A BLACK BOOT STEPS INTO SHOT!

FRODO looks up as ARAGORN towers over him.

ARAGORN

Frodo?

(CONTINUED)
 
163.

CONTINUED:

FRODO

(numb)
It has taken Boromir.

ARAGORN moves towards FRODO...

ARAGORN (urgent)

Where is the Ring?

FRODO backs away from ARAGORN ... ARAGORN is shocked by the movement.

FRODO

Stay away!

ARAGORN

Frodo ... I swore to protect you.

FRODO

Can you protect me from yourself?

CLOSE ON: FRODO uncurls his fist ... in his palm lies the RING! It glints, gold and beautiful in the afternoon sun ... ARAGORN’S eyes are drawn to it.

FRODO (CONT’D)
Would you destroy it?

THE RING

Aragorn. Aragorn. Elessar.

ARAGORN (kneeling to Frodo)

I would have gone with you to the end
... into the very fires of Mordor.

FRODO
I know. Look after the others, especially

Sam ... he will not understand.

ARAGORN FREEZES! He draws his sword.

ARAGORN (urgent)
Go, Frodo!

FRODO hesitates.

(CONTINUED)
 
164.

CONTINUED: (2)

ARAGORN (yells)
Run. Run!

FRODO backs away into the trees...

ANGLE ON: ...as 200 URUK-HAI SWARM onto AMON HEN behind ARAGORN!

ARAGORN attacks the leading URUK-HAI like a madman ... he brings two down with his sword leaping into the ruins as others close in on him.

ANGLE ON: FRODO scrambles down the HILLSIDE, away from the fight.

ANGLE ON: ARAGORN battles the URUK-HAI, amongst the pillars and blocks of AMON HEN. Despite his bravery, he is quickly surrounded.

SUDDENLY: ELVEN ARROWS smash into the URUK-HAI. LEGOLAS races out of the woods, firing his bow. GIMLI leaps into the battle, wielding his mighty axe.

EXT. PARTH GALEN HILLSIDE - DAY

FRODO is darting down the steep hillside as heavy feet thunder down after him.

SAM
Mr. Frodo!

ANGLE ON: SAM looks around for FRODO.

CLOSE ON: LURTZ ordering his URUKS.

LURTZ

Find the Halflings ... find the

Halflings!

ANGLE ON: FRODO stumbles and falls ... quickly he crawls behind a tree ... above him the sound of URUK-HAI crashing through the forest rings out.

MERRY (O.S.) (urgent whisper)
Frodo!

FRODO turns to see MERRY and PIPPIN hiding in a hollow, a few feet away.

(CONTINUED)
 
165.

CONTINUED:

MERRY (CONT’D)

Hide here, quick!

PIPPIN
Come on!

ANGLE ON: FRODO looks at his friends ... slowly shakes his head, a great sadness in his eyes.

PIPPIN (CONT’D)
What's he doing?

ANGLE ON: MERRY’S eyes meets FRODO’S. Understanding.

MERRY (softly)
He's leaving.

PIPPIN

No!

PIPPIN stands and makes a move toward FRODO .. MERRY grabs at his arm.

MERRY

Pippin!

ANGLE ON: MERRY and PIPPIN look up the slope where a cry has rings out. THEY HAVE BEEN SEEN!

MERRY (to Frodo)
Run, Frodo. Go on!

MERRY waves his arms at the approaching ORCS.

MERRY

Hey, hey you! Over here!

PIPPIN

Hey!

MERRY
Over here!

PIPPIN
This way!

(CONTINUED)
 
166.

MERRY and PIPPIN run, leading a pack of ORCS.

ANGLE ON: FRODO runs to the lake.

ANGLE ON: MERRY and PIPPIN, still running from the ORCS

PIPPIN
It's working!

MERRY
I know it's working! Run!

MERRY and PIPPIN stop ... more URUK-HAI approach from the other direction ... THEY ARE TRAPPED.

SUDDENLY! BOROMIR charges up the hillside and blocks the stroke of the leading URUK-HAI.

ANGLE ON: THE ECHO OF BOROMIR’S HORN reaches ARAGORN, LEGOLAS, and GIMLI ... they are battling their way down the SLOPES towards the lake.

LEGOLAS

The horn of Gondor!

ARAGORN

Boromir!

ARAGORN desperately slashes his way towards BOROMIR, felling URUK-HAI in his path ... while LEGOLAS and GIMLI fight a REAR

GUARD ACTION.

ANGLE ON: Many URUK-HAI fall to BOROMIR’S sword as he tries to

protect MERRY and PIPPIN...

BOROMIR

Run! Run!

ANGLE ON: LURTZ takes aim.

ANGLE ON: A BLACK ARROW suddenly THUDS into BOROMIR’S chest. Amazingly, BOROMIR continues fighting, but another arrow ... and another, brings him to his knees.

ANGLE ON: MERRY and PIPPIN are scooped off their feet by URUK-HAI.

MERRY & PIPPIN

Aaaaagh! Boromir! Boromir!

ANGLE ON: LURTZ aims his bow at BOROMIR’S heart ... suddenly ARAGORN charges at him, smashing the BOW with his sword. They lock into a deadly battle.

ANGLE ON: ARAGORN cuts LURTZ down and races towards BOROMIR, who lies slumped against a tree ... URUK-HAI arrows sticking out of his chest.

At least 20 dead URUK-HAI lie heaped around BOROMIR. His horn lies at his feet ... CLOVEN in two.

BOROMIR (painful gasp)
They took the little ones...

ARAGORN quickly tries to staunch the flow of BLOOD from BOROMIR’S shoulder.

BOROMIR (CONT’D) (panicked)

Frodo ... where is Frodo?

ARAGORN

I let Frodo go.

BOROMIR holds Aragorn’s gaze.

BOROMIR

Then you did what I could not. I tried to take the Ring from him.

ARAGORN
The Ring is beyond our reach now.

BOROMIR

Forgive me. I did not see ... I have failed you all.

ARAGORN

No, Boromir. You fought bravely. You have kept your honor.

ARAGORN tries to bind BOROMIR’S wound.

BOROMIR

Leave it! It is over ... the world of
Men will fall and all will come to

darkness and my city to ruin ...
Aragorn...

ARAGORN

I do not know what strength is in my blood, but I swear to you ... I will not let the White City fall, nor your people fail...

BOROMIR
Our people ... our people...

ARAGORN places BOROMIR’S sword in his hand. BOROMIR’S fingers tighten around the hilt.

BOROMIR (CONT’D)

I would have followed you, my brother

... my captain, my king.

ARAGORN lays BOROMIR down. He is dead.

ARAGORN

Be at peace, son of Gondor.

ARAGORN bends and KISSES BOROMIR’S forehead.

LEGOLAS and GIMLI appear behind him ... ARAGORN stands.

ARAGORN (CONT’D)
They will look for his coming from the

White Tower ... but he will not return.

EXT. SHORE OF NEN HITHOEL - DAY

On the lakeshore, FRODO stands in front of one of the ELVISH boats, the RING in his palm.

ANGLE ON: A distraught SAM ... running as hard as he can through
the forest...

SAM

Mr. Frodo!


(CONTINUED)
 
169.

CONTINUED:

CLOSE ON: FRODO looks to the far side of the river ... the CAMERA moves in on the RING.

FRODO (V.O.)

I wish the Ring had never come to me. I wish none of this had happened...

Tears fall down FRODO’S face...

GANDALF (V.O.)
So do all who live to see such times...

but that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us.

With renewed determination, FRODO tucks the RING inside his vest pocket.

ANGLE ON: The small figure of FRODO pushing the ELVISH boat into

the water...

ANGLE ON: SAM bursts through the trees and runs toward the lake

... FRODO is already paddling away.

SAM (anguished)
Not alone, Frodo. Mr. Frodo!

ANGLE ON: FRODO, in the boat, paddling steadfastly away from the shore ... tears in his eyes ... the voice of SAM carried on the wind. FRODO whispers to himself.

FRODO

No, Sam.

ANGLE ON: SAM looks at the water ... then at the boat.

SPLASH! FRODO turns to see SAM launching himself into the water.

FRODO

Go back, Sam! I'm going to Mordor alone.

ANGLE ON: SAM splashes hopelessly toward the boat.

SAM

Of course you are ... and I'm coming with you!

(CONTINUED)
 
170.

CONTINUED: (2)

FRODO

You can't swim.

SAM starts to go under, spluttering and coughing...

ANGLE ON: FRODO drops his paddle and scramble backwards in the

boat...

FRODO (CONT’D) (frightened)
Sam!

ANGLE ON: SAM is underwater ... hands flailing helplessly as he sinks.

CLOSE ON: FRODO’S hand grasping SAM’S...

ANGLE ON: FRODO pulls a bedraggled and half-drowned SAM into the boat. FRODO and SAM look at each other, out of breath, tears and water streaming down both their faces.

SAM

I made a promise, Mr. Frodo ... a promise.
(fierce passion)

“Don't you leave him, Samwise Gamgee.” (sobs)

And I don't mean to ... I don't mean to.

FRODO (crying)
Oh, Sam!

FRODO starts to laugh through his tears ... the two friends hug.

FRODO (CONT’D)

Come on then...

The two HOBBITS row through the water...

EXT. FALLS OF RAUROS AERIAL - DAY

SLOW MOTION: Looking down on swiftly flowing water ... BOROMIR’S body slides under CAMERA.

He is lying in one of the boats, his arms across his chest ...

his broken horn at his side.

(CONTINUED)
 
171.

CONTINUED:

SUDDENLY... the boat drops away from CAMERA ... as it plunges over the massive FALLS OF RAUROS, disappearing into the vapor below.

EXT. SHORE OF NEN HITHOEL - DAY

ANGLE ON: LEGOLAS pushes the last boat into the water.

LEGOLAS

If we are quick, we will catch Frodo and Sam before nightfall.

ARAGORN looks toward the far shore: FRODO and SAM’S small boat can be seen lying on the distant RIVERBANK as FRODO and SAM make off into the forest beyond. He doesn’t react.

ANGLE ON: LEGOLAS turns and looks at ARAGORN.

LEGOLAS (CONT’D)

You mean not to follow them...

ARAGORN

Frodo's fate is no longer in our hands.

GIMLI

Then it has all been in vain ... the

Fellowship has failed.

ARAGORN

Not if we hold true to each other. We will not abandon Merry and Pippin to torment and death, not while we have strength left.

ARAGORN pulls a HUNTING KNIFE out of his pack and straps it on.

ARAGORN

Leave all that can be spared behind.

CLOSE ON: ARAGORN ... a steely light in his eye.

ARAGORN (CONT’D) (grimly)
We travel light. Let’s hunt some Orc.

GIMLI
Yes! Ha!

(CONTINUED)
 
172.

CONTINUED:

ARAGORN, LEGOLAS, and GIMLI disappear into the WOODS, following the URUK-HAI trail.

EXT. EMYN MUIL HILLTOP - DAY

FRODO and SAM scramble onto a high ridge.

WIDE ON: A distant line of SAW TOOTHED mountains below a dark, oppressive sky. Black volcanic smoke rises behind the mountains

... MORDOR!

ANGLE ON: FRODO and SAM look with grim determination.

FRODO

Mordor! I hope the others find a safer road.

SAM (simply)

Strider’ll look after them.

FRODO

I don't suppose we'll ever see them again.

SAM

We may yet, Mr. Frodo. We may.

FRODO
Sam?

FRODO looks at SAM with great affection ... despite the grim
outlook, SAM is undeterred...

FRODO (CONT’D)
I'm glad you're with me.

WIDE ON: THE TWO HOBBITS SETTING OFF TOWARD MORDOR.
